# Multi-Omics Analysis Pipelines

Welcome to the Multi-Omics Analysis Pipelines repository. This repository contains a collection of scripts and tools for performing comprehensive multi-omics data analysis. These pipelines integrate various omics data types, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, to provide a holistic understanding of biological systems.

## Introduction

The multi-omics analysis pipelines in this repository are designed to facilitate the integration and analysis of various omics datasets. By combining data from different omics layers, these pipelines help in uncovering complex biological interactions and mechanisms.

## Features

- **Data Integration:** Seamlessly integrate genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data.
- **Comprehensive Analysis:** Perform differential expression analysis, pathway enrichment, network analysis, and more.
- **Scalability:** Handle large-scale datasets with efficient computation.
- **Customization:** Easily customize the pipelines to suit specific research needs.

## Installation

To use the pipelines, you need to have Python and other dependencies installed. Follow the steps below to set up your environment:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multi-omics-analysis-pipelines.git
    cd multi-omics-analysis-pipelines
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

The pipelines are organized into separate scripts for different analysis tasks. Here is a basic example of how to run a pipeline:

1. Prepare your input data files (see [Input Data](#input-data) section for details).
2. Run the desired pipeline script:
    ```bash
    python genomics_pipeline.py --input data/genomics_data.csv --output results/genomics_output
    ```

Refer to the documentation of each script for specific usage instructions and parameters.

## Pipeline Overview

### Genomics Pipeline
- **Description:** Processes and analyzes genomic data.
- **Script:** `genomics_pipeline.py`

### Transcriptomics Pipeline
- **Description:** Processes and analyzes transcriptomic data.
- **Script:** `transcriptomics_pipeline.py`

### Proteomics Pipeline
- **Description:** Processes and analyzes proteomic data.
- **Script:** `proteomics_pipeline.py`

### Metabolomics Pipeline
- **Description:** Processes and analyzes metabolomic data.
- **Script:** `metabolomics_pipeline.py`

## Input Data

Each pipeline requires specific input data formats. Below are the details:

- **Genomics Data:** CSV or TSV file with columns for sample identifiers and genomic features.
- **Transcriptomics Data:** CSV or TSV file with columns for sample identifiers and transcript expression levels.
- **Proteomics Data:** CSV or TSV file with columns for sample identifiers and protein abundance levels.
- **Metabolomics Data:** CSV or TSV file with columns for sample identifiers and metabolite concentrations.

Ensure that your input data files are properly formatted before running the pipelines.

## Output

The output files will be saved in the specified output directory. Each pipeline generates different types of output, including:

- Processed data files
- Analysis reports
- Visualization plots
- Summary statistics
